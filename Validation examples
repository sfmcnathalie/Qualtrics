Scenario 1:  validate that answer is text-only, no spaces, and less than 10 length
Solution: 
Use "match regex" in custom validation and put this in validation text entry box:
^[A-Za-z]{1,9}$

The respondent will be only allowed to move to next question if they enter at least one and at most 9 characers in text box 
and characters can only be small and capital letters.


Scenario 2: Validate Address has been fully submitted - Street2 is not required
Solution: 
Click Blue text at bottom of your form = "Click here to edit form fields" & edit validation/forced response
Do not select "Forced Response" in Right menu
Do not select Validation in Right Menu
